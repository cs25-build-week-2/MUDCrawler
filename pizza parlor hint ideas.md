Red Egg Pizza Parlor (ideally room 314, but ALSO have 314 close to room 0)

A pizza parlor stands before you. A sign states "true wisdom is the real treasure". A spot next to the sign has a giant X on it.


You place your `treasure name` on the marked X and it disappears, replaced by a delicious slice of pizza. As you eat your slice of pizza, you begin to ponder....

what if you could fly?
what happens if you try to fly in a cave?
how long does it take me to dash through 2 rooms? what about 3 rooms?
what if you could wear all the treasure you've gathered?
0x48! 0xa8! 0x82! 0xab! HLT! WELL that was weird... but why was it so famiLiar? Seems str8nge.   // the capitalization of this is important
why am you naked? travel seems dangerous like this.

about how some rooms take longer to travel through than others. could you find a better way?

how many ways are there to move around?

that some things might reveal secrets upon further inspection

where do you end up when you warp?
nothing. you just REALLY want a donut.
how long it would take to gather 2000 gold. but what would you do with it?
in the long run, can a donut pay for itself?

and realize treasures will probably be where people aren't, and people tend to congregrate near.... but then you saw a squirrel and was distracted.

do snitches really get stitches? or maybe they get rewarded instead

is a herring a bird? or is it a fish? does it matter if it's red?

what if your soul was ripped through space and time into another dimension? If you moved around and yanked back to your original dimension, would you be close to where you started?

Pouring a cup of coffee on your face helps you to wake up more than by drinking it.

The birth of Kool-aid man had to be traumatic.

other ideas
timedust - once a player collects 10 it forms into a timepiece with a button. you press the button and the golden snitch stops spawning for 30 minutes (too elusive until you pray at the respective shrine)
stardust - once you collect enough, a meteor shatters in the (underworld) sky, raining down a couple hundred golden snitches randomly over the map (too hot to touch until you pray at the shrine)
blue snail shell piece - rare item - collect four and use it to curse the player currently in first place for 10 minutes, reducing their speed
tiger wizard closet - allows you to teleport to a chosen room. consumed upon use.
astral projection - be able to see into another room or see where a certain player is/snoopy information about them
warp and recall should benefit from nextRoomID
