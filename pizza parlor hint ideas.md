Red Egg Pizza Parlor (ideally room 314, but ALSO have 314 close to room 0)

A pizza parlor stands before you. A sign states "true wisdom is the real treasure". A spot next to the sign has a giant X on it.


You place your `treasure name` on the marked X and it disappears, replaced by a delicious slice of pizza. As you eat your slice of pizza, you begin to ponder....

what if you could fly?
what happens if you try to fly in a cave?
how long does it take me to dash through 2 rooms? what about 3 rooms?
what if you could wear all the treasure you've gathered?
0x48! 0xa8! 0x82! 0xab! HLT! WELL that was weird... but why was it so famiLiar? Seems str8nge.   // the capitalization of this is important
why am you naked? travel seems dangerous like this.

about how some rooms take longer to travel through than others. could you find a better way?

how many ways are there to move around?


where do you end up when you warp?
nothing. you just REALLY want a donut.
how long it would take to gather 2000 gold. but what would you do with it?
could it be? is it possible? 

and realize treasures will probably be where people aren't, and people tend to congregrate near.... but then you saw squirrel and was distracted.
